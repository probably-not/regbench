# Regbench

Some benchmarks of registries in Elixir in order to understand what issues there are in scale.

Benchmarks were ported (or at least I attempted to port them) from the [@ostinelli blog post about Process Registries in Erlang](http://www.ostinelli.net/an-evaluation-of-erlang-global-process-registries-meet-syn/).

Of course... I'm not great at Erlang, so maybe I screwed up the porting...
